Steps to integrate in a  WOOOF Application
-------------------------------------------

(dirs/urls are relative to application/ )

1. The class AltoRouter.php is already in wooof_classes/thirdParty/ (so it will be autoloaded).
2. Copy the util/AltoRouter/.htaccess file to publicSite/
3. Edit publicSite/.htaccess
    --> change the 'RewriteBase' to the appURL/publicSiteURL

3a. Copy the util/AltoRouter/.htaccess file to publicSite/
3b. Process 6 later on...

4. Edit ./index.php
    --> redirect to : header( 'Location: publicSite/' );

5. Try http://.../application
    --> Should see 'Hello!' echoed on the screen

6. The difficult part
    State the routes (all in publicSite/index.php or in files required from there).
    For starters you can use simple function closures echoeing the route plus params.
    Build the controllers (place them in classes/) and
    call them from the routes.

7. Finished!
